# Writeups

This repository contains the written writeups from CTFs and boxes from places such as HackTheBox and TryHackMe. Most writeups will have a markdown variant, with some being exported in a Report-style format in PDF.

You can find the PDF versions [here](https://github.com/shrikeinfosec/Writeups/tree/main/PDF%20Exports).
